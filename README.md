# SeaChest
A simple, unofficial Dropbox client for SFOS

Version 0.1

SeaChest is an unofficial app and is in no way associated with Dropbox, Inc.

<h3>Supports</h3>

- Download individual files (as of now only one at a time).
- Upload files up to 150MB.
- Basic icon categories for file listings.
- Images can be previewed by viewing menu for an image file (jpg, jpeg, png, tiff, tif, gif, webp, ppm and bmp).

<h3>Issues & Limitations</h3>

- If downloading a file and uploading at the same time, progress bars at bottom of screen may not look right.
- When loading a folder, reauthorization should work but there may still be issues with uploading or downloading a file first thing after an access token has expired. Workaround would be to refresh folder and try again.
- Plan to add support for renaming and other additional features if time allows. Was created as a basic way of downloading new RPMs from Dropbox folder without needing Android Support.
